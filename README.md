This is a C++ Library, developed by Ko van der Sloot, for working with the
[Format for Linguistic Annotation (FoLiA)](https://proycon.github.io/folia/).
The software is intended for C++ developers, and provides a high-level
API to read, manipulate, and create FoLiA documents. This software is a
necessary dependency for various other tools that use FoLiA.

libfolia is distributed under the GNU Public Licence v3 (see the file COPYING).

[PyNLPl](https://github.com/proycon/pynlpl)), and draws from the same external specification.

Libfolia is used by various in-house projects:
 * [ucto](https://LanguageMachines.github.io/ucto)
 * [frog](https://LanguageMachines.github.io/frog)
 * [foliautils](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/foliautils)
 * [colibri-core](https://proycon.github.io/colibri-core)
 * [wopr](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/wopr)

Libfolia is tested (unit and integration tests) using the following extensive test suite:
 * [foliatest](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/foliatest)
